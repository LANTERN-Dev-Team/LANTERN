# Notes
- Lantern is **very early** in development. It currently does not have any internal connection to minecraft other than basic events. [e.g. Joining a world.]
- Lantern *does* have a license, and while we want you to feel safe using our mod, we also want to protect our work, and our users.
- **Do not share your public IP address to people you do not trust.** We are not liable for any damages that result.
