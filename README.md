# LANTERN
Free, Open-Source, Peer-to-Peer multiplayer for Minecraft.

[See the Modrinth page!](https://modrinth.com/project/p2p-lantern)


# Notes
- Lantern is **very early** in development. It currently does not have any internal connection to minecraft other than basic events. [e.g. Joining a world.]
- Lantern *does* have a license, and while we want you to feel safe using our mod, we also want to protect our work.
